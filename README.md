**Automated skill builder for Claude Code** - Describe a skill you need, and Claude Code generates it following best practices automatically.

## What is This?

Skilz is a **meta-repository** that teaches Claude Code how to write high-quality skills. It contains:

1. **skill-builder skill** - A skill that Claude loads to learn how to write skills
2. **Comprehensive evaluations** - 12 test cases to validate skill quality
3. **Comprehensive templates** - 8 ready-to-use skill patterns
4. **Complete examples** - Production-quality skills demonstrating best practices
5. **Validation tools** - Automated checking of skill requirements
6. **Full documentation** - Everything you need to understand skills

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd skilz
npm install
```

### 2. Use Claude Code to Build a Skill

Claude Code will automatically load the skill-builder skill and generate properly structured skills:

```
You: Create a skill for analyzing SQL query performance

Claude: I'll create a skill for SQL query performance analysis...
[Generates complete skill with proper YAML frontmatter, structure, and content]
```

That's it! Claude Code reads the skill-builder skill and knows how to:
- Structure YAML frontmatter correctly
- Write effective descriptions with triggers
- Apply appropriate patterns (analysis, workflow, etc.)
- Use progressive disclosure when needed
- Follow all best practices

### 3. Validate Your Skill

```bash
npm run validate .claude/skills/sql-analyzer
```

Output:
```
✓ name field valid: sql-analyzer
✓ description field valid (245 chars)
✓ SKILL.md length: 287 lines
✓ No Windows-style paths found
✓ All validations passed!
```

### 4. Use Your Skill

Your skill is now ready! Claude Code will automatically use it when relevant.

## How It Works

### The Meta-Skill

The core of this repository is `.claude/skills/skill-builder/SKILL.md` - a skill that teaches Claude how to write skills.

When you ask Claude Code to create a skill, it:

1. **Loads skill-builder** - The meta-skill activates automatically
2. **Applies best practices** - Follows conciseness, progressive disclosure, workflows
3. **Chooses right pattern** - Selects appropriate template (analysis, workflow, etc.)
4. **Generates valid structure** - Creates proper YAML frontmatter and organization
5. **Validates requirements** - Ensures name/description format is correct

### Example Interaction

**You ask:**
```
Create a skill for reviewing API designs
```

**Claude Code:**
1. Recognizes this is a skill creation request
2. Loads `.claude/skills/skill-builder/SKILL.md`
3. Determines this needs the "analysis-skill" pattern
4. Generates complete SKILL.md with:
   - Valid YAML frontmatter (`name: reviewing-api-designs`)
   - Specific description with triggers
   - Structured analysis process
   - Checklist workflow
   - Output template
   - Examples

**Result:** A production-ready skill following all best practices.

## What Makes Skills Effective?

The skill-builder teaches Claude these core principles:

### 1. Conciseness

Only include what Claude doesn't already know:
- ✗ Don't explain what PDFs are
- ✗ Don't explain how npm works
- ✓ Do provide specific commands
- ✓ Do document domain conventions

### 2. Appropriate Degrees of Freedom

Match specificity to task fragility:
- **High freedom**: Text instructions for flexible tasks
- **Medium freedom**: Pseudocode for preferred patterns
- **Low freedom**: Exact scripts for critical operations

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

Structure content for on-demand loading:
- SKILL.md as table of contents
- Details in separate files
- Claude reads only what's needed

### 4. Workflows and Feedback

For multi-step tasks:
- Provide checkbox checklists
- Clear validation points
- Validate → Fix → Repeat pattern

### 5. Testing and Evaluation

Comprehensive test suite ensures quality:
- **12 evaluation test cases** covering all skill aspects
- **Baseline comparison** to measure improvement
- **Success criteria** (10/12 passing = 83%)
- **Iteration guidance** for continuous improvement

See `.claude/skills/skill-builder/EVALUATIONS.md` for complete testing guide.

## Using Templates Directly

You can also copy templates manually:

```bash
# Copy template to your project
